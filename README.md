# OpenFlowMeter
## Purpose
Measuring flow of gases and maybe liquids. 

## Principle
Measures the volume flow by the amount of heat transferred to a gas flow.

# References
The working principle of this device is adapted from a proposal of the LHC gas group at CERN. In addition there is a report of a student, explaining / proposing this technique more in detail.
